# reproducing_bioinformatics
A personal project on retraining myself bioinformatic techniques.

---
My first semester in the bioinformatic program at Georgia Tech was truly challenging, but I learned so much. I was inspired to start my own project to improve my fluency in the bioinformatics. This is the first project which focuses on basic bioinformatic techniques which are drawn from what I learned but molded by my personal curiosity in bioinformatics. This is the start of a journey of publishing my work on github, and there will be more projects to come.

Because I want to emphasize reproducibility (also as a guide for my future self), I chose jupyter notebook as the displaying format. My hope is that the repository contains comprehensive demonstrations that can one day be shared as a guide to beginners in the bioinformatics.
